Jetty Version Maven Plugin
==========================

Jetty specific Maven plugin for managing the VERSION.txt file

This is not a generally useful maven plugin for other projects, and is
highly Jetty specific.

If you have an interest in this plugin, and want to make it more generic
for other projects, submit a Pull Request!
