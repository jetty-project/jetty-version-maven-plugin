jetty-1.3.4 - 15 March 1998
 + Dump servlet enhanced to exercise these changes.
 + Fixed handling of multiple parameters in query and form content.
   "?A=1%2C2&A=C%2CD" now returns two values ("1,2" & "C,D") rather than 4.
 + ServletHandler now takes an optional file base directory name which is used
   to set the translated path for pathInfo in servlet requests.
