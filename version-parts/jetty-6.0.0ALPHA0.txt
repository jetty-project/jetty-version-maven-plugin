jetty-6.0.0ALPHA0
 + file may be sent as sent is a single operation.
 + Improved "dependancy injection" and "inversion of control" design of
   components
 + Improved "interceptor" design of handlers
 + Missing Request Dispatchers
 + Missing Security
 + Missing war support
 + Missing web.xml based configuration
 + Optional use of NIO Buffering so that efficient direct buffers and memory
   mapped files can be used.
 + Optional use of NIO gather writes, so that for example a HTTP header and a
   memory mapped
 + Optional use of NIO non-blocking scheduling so that threads are not
   allocated per connection.
 + Smart split buffer design allows large buffers to only be allocated to
   active connections. The resulting memory savings allow very large buffers to
   be used, which increases the chance of efficient asynchronous flushing and
   of avoiding chunking.
 + Totally rearchitected and rebuilt, so 10 years of cruft could be removed!
