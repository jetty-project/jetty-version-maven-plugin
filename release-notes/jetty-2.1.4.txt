jetty-2.1.4 - 26 March 1999
 + fixed bug in getRealPath
 + Fixed problem compiling PathMap under some JDKs.
 + getPathTranslated now call getRealPath with pathInfo (as per spec).
 + HttpRequest attributes implemented.
 + pathInfo returns null for zero length pathInfo (as per spec). Sorry if this
   breaks your servlets - it is a pain!
 + Reduced HTML dependence in HTTP package to allow minimal configuration
 + Session max idle time implemented.
 + Tightened license agreement so that binary distributions are required to
   include the license file.
