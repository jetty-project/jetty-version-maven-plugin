jetty-2.0.3 - 13 November 1998
 + Fix bug with index files for Jetty.Server. Previously servers configured
   with com.mortbay.Jetty.Server would not handle index.html files.  Need to
   make this configurable in the prp file.
 + Fixed errors in README file: com.mortbay.Jetty.Server was called
   com.mortbay.HTTP.Server
 + Limit threads in ThreadedServer and low priority listener option greatly
   improve performance under worse case loads.
