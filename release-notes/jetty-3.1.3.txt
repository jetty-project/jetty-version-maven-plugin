jetty-3.1.3 - 26 October 2001
 + Allow a per context UserRealm instance.
 + Correct dispatch to error pages with javax attributes set.
 + Fixed binary files in CVS
 + Fixed several problems with external role authentication. Role
   authentication in JBoss was not working correctly and there were possible
   object leaks. The fix required an API change to UserPrinciple and UserRealm.
 + Fixed Virtual hosts to case insensitive.
 + Fix security problem with trailing special characters. Trailing %00 enabled
   JSP source to be viewed or other servlets to be bypassed.
 + Improved FORM auth handling of role failure.
 + Improved Jasper debug output.
 + Improved ThreadedServer timeout defaults
 + PathMap spec separator changed from ',' to ':'. May be set with
   org.mortbay.http.PathMap.separators system property.
 + Upgraded JSSE to 1.0.2
