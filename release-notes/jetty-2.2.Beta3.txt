jetty-2.2.Beta3 - 22 June 1999
 + Added alternate constructors to HTML.Include for InputStream.
 + Added file cache to FileHandler
 + Applied contributed patch of spelling and typo corrections
 + Fixed bug in HttpResponse flush.
 + Fixed file and socket leaks in Include and Embed tags.
 + Implemented efficient version of ServletContext.getResourceAsStream() that
   does not open a new socket connection (as does getResource()).
 + Improved Block.write.
 + LookAndFeelServlet uses getResourceAsStream to get the file to wrap. This
   allows it to benefit from any caching done and to wrap arbitrary content
   (not just files).
 + Ran dos2unix on all text files
 + Re-implemented ThreadedServer to improve and balance performance.
 + Restructure demo so that LookAndFeel content comes from simple handler
   stack.
 + Server.shutdown() clears configuration so that server may be restarted in
   same virtual machine.
